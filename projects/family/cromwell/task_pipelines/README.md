## Task Pipelines

This directory has all the tasks that we uses in the workflows 


### `resources.wdl`
This file sets the resources that are available to use. This way we do not have
to keep setting it in the input files


### `alignment.wdl`
This file does the alignment step together with some BAM file processing to end
up with a sorted unique BAM file ready for further processing.
